#  jQuery iframe auto height plugin

## Usage:

* include jquery in your page
* include js/jquery.iframe-auto-height.plugin.js
* use the variable jQuery or its alias $ and pass a selector that matches one or more iframes

`jQuery('iframe').iframeAutoHeight();` will resize all iframes on the page

`$('iframe.photo').iframeAutoHeight();` will resize only iframes with the css class photo

`$('iframe').iframeAutoHeight({heightOffset: 20});` optionally add some buffer to the bottom (unit is pixels) 

`$('iframe').iframeAutoHeight({callback: function(callbackObject){alert(callbackObject.newFrameHeight);}});` optionally define a callback function (in this case inline) that will do something with the callbackObject.newFrameHeight value. This can for instance be used with easyXDM to alert another domain that the frame has changed height. (See http://github.com/oyvindkinsey/easyXDM.)

code can be called from within $(document).ready or after iframes are declared in markup
see index.html

## Summary:

original code by NATHAN SMITH; see [http://sonspring.com/journal/jquery-iframe-sizing](http://sonspring.com/journal/jquery-iframe-sizing)

The plugin will resize an iframe to the height of its contents

will NOT work if the iframe contains a page from another domain

When viewing code locally (file:///) Google chrome will throw errors, 
works fine in Firefox locally and should work
ok in all browsers when served from the same domain. 

with IE8 it seems better to not specify the height attribute on the iframe

so far tested on 

* IE8 on windows
* Firefox 3.6 on windows
* Chrome 6 on windows
* Firefox 3.6 on Mac
